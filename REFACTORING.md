# Refactoring Documentation

This document explains the refactoring work done to improve the codebase structure and maintainability.

## Overview of Changes

The codebase has been completely restructured following SOLID and DRY principles to improve maintainability, scalability, and testability.

### Directory Structure

```

│   ├── core/           # Core functionality
│   │   ├── chatgpt-service.ts  # ChatGPT interaction service
│   │   └── mcp-server.ts       # MCP protocol implementation
│   ├── utils/          # Shared utilities

└── dist/               # Compiled JavaScript output
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns

- **Service Layer**: Extracted all ChatGPT interaction logic into a dedicated service class
- **MCP Protocol**: Separated MCP server implementation from business logic
- **Configuration**: Centralized configuration management with environment variables
- **Logging**: Created a unified logging system with file/console output options

### 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

- Consolidated duplicate AppleScript code across test scripts and main functionality
- Created reusable utilities for common operations (clipboard handling, error processing)
- Standardized error handling and response formatting

### 3. Configuration Management

- Added `.env` support for customizable configuration
- Created default configuration with reasonable values
- Implemented a setup script for easy environment configuration

### 4. Improved Testing Capabilities

- Separate test scripts for different functionality
- Better command-line argument parsing for test scripts
- Progress reporting during long-running operations
- Detailed logging for debugging

### 5. Better Error Handling

- Comprehensive error handling throughout the codebase
- Descriptive error messages with context
- Fallback mechanisms for recoverable errors
- Error logging with stack traces

### 6. Code Quality Improvements

- Added TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Implemented consistent coding style with ESLint and Prettier
- Added comprehensive documentation with JSDoc comments
- Improved naming conventions for better readability

## Environment Configuration

The `.env` file (created from `.env.example` using `npm run setup`) allows configuration of:

- Debug mode
- Logging options (console/file, level)
- Timeouts for different operation types
- UI interaction delays
- Response detection parameters

## New Scripts

- `npm run setup`: Initialize environment configuration
- `npm run test`: Run general tests with various options
- `npm run test:search`: Run search-specific tests
- `npm run lint`: Check code quality with ESLint
- `npm run format`: Format code with Prettier

## Using the Refactored Code

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility with existing MCP integrations while providing a more robust foundation for future development. The core functionality remains the same, but with significantly improved error handling, configurability, and maintainability.
